msgid "Mollom can be used to block all sorts of spam received by your website. Your Drupal site will send data you want checked for spam to the Mollom servers, which will reply with either 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam). If Mollom is not fully confident in its decision, it will ask the user to fill out a CAPTCHA.  On the rare occasion that Mollom asks the poster to fill out a CAPTCHA, Mollom assumes that all legitimate posters will take the extra time to fill out this CAPTCHA.  Using the CAPTCHA, Mollom avoids legitimate messages being incorrectly classified as spam and it eliminates the need to moderate messages that Mollom decided to block.  Administrators can still inspect the <a href=\"@logs\">logs</a> to see what Mollom has blocked."
