Category Settings
=================
For each category, you can choose whether it is enabled, how many links to display
and the maximum number of entries to display in a block, if one is enabled.

Blocks
======
A block is created automatically for every weblink category (this includes subcategories).
These can be enabled individually.
Enable these as usual in the admin/block page.
