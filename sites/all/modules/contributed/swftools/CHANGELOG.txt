Quick fix for #384876 until I can come up with a better solution (prevents the
SWF Tools playlist cache clear from deleting everything in the root of the file
system!)

12 February 2009
----------------
#371735 - Fixed - incorrect construction of id tag in HTML.

07 October 2008
---------------
#308515 - Fixed - string used for determining extension was empty when a remote
file is being checked, so code changed to check a more appropriate string.

03 October 2008
---------------
#314045 - Constants incorrectly defined - fixed.

02 October 2008
---------------
#308172 - Extra / in url when using a remote media path. This is fixed.
As a result of this bug fix some other issues with the remote media system
were found. In particular, the players were no longer automatically detected
for size. This is fixed.

8 September 2008
----------------
Added better support for id parameter in SWF Object 2 embedding.
Fixed colour settings page for 1 Pixel Out player.

7 September 2008
----------------
Fixed accidental carry over of drupal_flush_all_caches() from SWF Tools 6!

6 September 2008
----------------
New release for Drupal 5. Many changes from SWF Tools 6 have been back ported
including private file support, fix for odd encoding that upsets 1 Pixel Out
player, support for SWF Object 2, support for JW Media Player 4, support for
FlowPlayer. Also fixes full screen and base parameter errors that occurred if
using direct embedding.

23 August 2008
--------------
SWFObject 2 module updated with code from SWF Tools 6 - now generates the flash
vars using the array format, rather than the string format (minor change, but
makes code more legible). Also now assigns an id to the objects which fixes a
"Done, with errors" issue when using JW Media Player 4 on IE6.
