The module includes a plug-in theme for Views to display available date fields
in calendar displays. To use it, select the Calendar display as the 
page type for your view and add any date fields you want to display on the calendar
as fields to the view. Date fields can include CCK date fields, event start and end
dates, or dates like the node created or updated dates.

Add three arguments to the view: Calendar Year, Calendar Month, and Calendar Day, in
that order. Set each of them to 'Display All Values'.

A mini calendar is available using the block view if the block view is also set
to the Calendar type.

Two other blocks are available. A legend block will display only on calendar pages
and will show a legend of the color coding for field names and content types.

A Switch Calendar block will display only on calendar pages and allows the user
to switch between calendar, list, table, teaser, and full node views for whichever
time period is being viewed. The back/next navigation will remain at the top of the
traditional views displays so you can move from one month to the next, for instance.
