Installation instructions:

1) Install the cck files from http://drupal.org/project/date.

2) Upload the date files to a 'date' folder in the modules directory. You should end
   up with a structure like: drupal/modules/date/date.module. You can also place it
   inside the cck folder. Either location will work.

   * Optional * Download the adodb date library from 
   http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/adodb_date_library
   and add it to the folder. If included, it will allow you to use dates from
   the year 100 to the year 3000. Without it, most date handling is limited to
   1970 to 2038.
   
3) Go to admin/modules and enable the date module. Be sure to submit the page
   even if the date module is already selected. That will update the path to the files.

4) Go to admin/node/types to view cck content types. Add or select a content type.

5) While viewing a cck content type, select the option to add a new field. Several
   options for date fields should be visible.
   
6) If you already have date fields created from an earlier version, be sure to
   edit each one and save your changes. There may be new options available that need to be set.
